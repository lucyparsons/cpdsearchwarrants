# Chicago Police Search Warrant Data

Five years of executed search warrants by Chicago Police (2012-2017) including geolocation (via GeoJSON files), CSVs and some raw code to do the data visualization currently hosted [here](https://viz.mchap.io/search_warrants)

## What is Included in Here
The _location_ of the execution of a search warrant covering five years. We sent a [Freedom of Information Act](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/chicago-169/search-warrant-log-56379/) request for the data and had to spend ~1 year going back and forward them on it. 

**Note:** Not all search warrants lead to arrests. In fact, you may see a lot of search warrants for "3300 W Fillmore St" which is the same building as CPD's Evidence Collection Unit. (As decided in _Riley vs California_, yes police do need to get a warrant to search your phone).

## What is Not Included in Here

Search warrants that are not executed. 
A search warrant breakdown between felony review or narcotics.
